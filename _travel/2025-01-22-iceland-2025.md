## Itinerary

### **Conditions in July** - 

* ~20 hrs of sunlight
* Sunrise ~4 AM
* Sunset ~11 PM


### **High Level Tasklist** -

1. Book flight tickets after confirmation of the travel date. ✅
2. Rental car booking ✅
3. Decide places to visit ✅
4. Define an itinerary ✅
5. Accommodation ✅
6. Meal-planning/Food ?
7. Schengen Visa Application ✅
    1. Look into this after March 23
    2. ~3 weeks processing time ✅
    3. Travel insurance (required for visa application) ✅


### **Booking TODO List** -

1. Day 1 Blue Lagoon ticket (Sid; need to book) []
    1. Pre-booking is absolutely essential as otherwise, slots may run out. Ref - [https://www.bluelagoon.com/support/blue-lagoon/before-you-visit](https://www.bluelagoon.com/support/blue-lagoon/before-you-visit) ✅
    2. I think the *Comfort package* ($100/person) should be enough. ✅


2. Day 2 ATV tour - Decide the time for the ATV tour, 12 PM vs 3 PM depending on whether we wanna check out LCM. (Sid; need to book)
    3. Book for 3 PM. ✅
3. Day 3 - Book for the boat tour. [10am, Sathvik] ✅
4. Day 3 - Stay @ Hafaldan HI hostel. ✅
5. Day 4 - Myvatn [https://goo.gl/maps/htLeahZZXUbxwjvt5](https://goo.gl/maps/htLeahZZXUbxwjvt5) (Hlid Hostel) ✅
6. Day 6: Snaefelles Peninsula: [http://www.thefreezerhostel.com/](http://www.thefreezerhostel.com/) (Hostel) ✅
7. Day 9 - Whale watching tour (Cherry; need to fix time and book) ✅ 
    5. Seems like the Standard Whale Watching one is the best option. We’ve got one at 9:00 AM and with ~3 hrs spent, should still give us enough time to make it to the airport 3 hrs before departure. 
8. Travel Insurance for Schengen Visa (Cherry/Sid to look into). Couple of different options:
    6. Europ Assistance (Costs $97 for 3 people): No-frills plan ✅

* Can potentially camp 1 or even 2 nights
    * Although seems like no reservations are possible on the campsites.
        * Thingvellir NP
        * Snaefellsnes Peninsula
    * This can be clubbed with star-gazing maybe.


## Itinerary Option-1:

We drive around the entire island, the second-half of the trip would have a lot of driving involved.


### Day 1, Saturday, July 1

    * A vista point - stop along the road, view-point of the Iceland coast.

### Day 3, Monday, July 3

Note -

2. If we decide to skip the Glacier Lagoon Boat Tour, then we can directly head towards our next destination, and this day would be entirely driving around (I don’t mind).

    * Boat tours around a lake dotted with towering icebergs carved from the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier.

        * Check-in for the boat tour 30 min before the start time.

    * Or alternatively, can we find another place to stay for the night, and we can add some extra driving hours into the next day?

Given that we’d have 8 days to explore, each of us can come up with a list of top places we’d like to see, and then we can work backward from there in choosing equally from amongst all the places that each one of us came up with.
