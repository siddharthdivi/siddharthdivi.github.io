#### **Incoming Flight (2023/07/28): San Francisco**  The only viable option to Bergen seems like [this KLM flight](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/s/ma1BRYvES1VUSJyi7) with 2hr 45 min layover in Amsterdam. It is one the fastest flights there (based on duration), at a reasonable time.

## Day 1 (2023/06/29)

### Plan for the day:

* Land in Bergen at 1:25 PM. Should take us 1 hr or so to clear customs and pick up the rental car  
* Should reach Bergen Hostel @ 3:00 PM; right around check-in time. The [drive from airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKUDSsk1Q3VzTnpLA) is \~25 mins.  
* Freshen up and get ready to leave hostel by 4:00 PM  
* Take the car to Bergen and spend time in the city. Check out the list of things to do to make the actual plan. **Actual Plan for the Day:**  
  * After hostel, take Floyen funicular to the top of Floyen and then hike down via Stoltzekleiven (total time of 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs)  
  * Continue walking around the city to Bryggen Wharf (\~30 mins)  
  * Spend some more time walking around in the Fish Market (should be another 30 mins). Can also have some snacks along the way  
  * Walk back to Floyen funicular parking (20 mins) and take car back to hostel (\~15 mins). Should be 8:00 \- 8:30 by this point  
* Take the [Ulriken Cable Car](https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/ulriken643-ulriken-cable-car-p824813) and have dinner on top of the mountain @ Skyskraperen Restaurant. The restaurant and cable car are open till 11:00 PM on saturday, but we should target 8:30 to 9:00 PM to be on safe side and wind up fo the night  
  * Or do early supper (maybe at 5/6). The cable car point is walking distance from the hostel, so it is in our hands. City sightseeing can be done after

### Things to see:

* **Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf**: Historic city center. Slow walk and enjoy time  
* **Mount Floyen & the Funicular**: Good place for views and has a fun train ride.   
* **Bergen Fish Market**: Nice place to walk and snack with variety of seafood  
* **Ulriken Cable Car**: Near the hostel and nice views along with restaurant at top  
* **~~Food & Culture Tour~~**~~: Not available in our timing~~  
* **Stoltzekleiven**: Another mountain that we can hike on; it takes about 30 mins to top. Can also go to Floyen to take the funicular down. Can spend 1-1.5 hrs here to cover both  
* **Museums**: There is variety of collections of Museums in Bergen, but not sure which or how many of them will be open during our times (All museums might close at our timing)  
  * Bryggens Museum  
  * Kode Art & Composition Museums  
  * Troldhaugen Composer Museum  
  * Rasmussens Collections  
  * Bergens Tekniske Museums  
  * Gestapo Museum & More

### Stay for the night:

### Meals for the day:

* Breakfast and lunch should be covered by the flight and breaks in the airport.  
* Dinner should be at the top of the Ulriken mountain; can decide between supper and dinner for timing

### Bookings to make:

* Rental car pickup at Avis in Bergen. There’s an [Avis inside the airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JJm1q2aYE5Uar8GbA), so we can pick up directly from there. We will probably be returning this in Trondheim, but more on that later.  
* Ulriken Cable car & reservation for Skyskraperen restaurant  
* Can add more as we nail down things to do

## Day 2 (2023/06/30)

* Start Trolltunga hike immediately on reaching the place. We should have already set up a lot of the requirements the day before: backpack, gear and packed food; so not a lot of time wasted. We have 2 options for the hike  
  * Start at P2 and expect a 10-12 hr hike, so we make our way back by 9 \-10 PM  
  * Start at P3 (higher vantage point) and expect a 7-9 hr hike and come back by 6 \- 7 PM  
    * Note times also include time spent at the top with lunch and everything else  
* Dinner as soon as we make windfall back on ground and drive to Hardanger Hostel to crash for the night ([drive takes \~45 mins](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CkDaPH45EQYCxNfR7))

### Bookings to make:

* Car Parking at Trolltunga P2

* We can take the train at 10:45 AM or 12:10 PM; whichever is better and the rest of the tour package will settle itself around the start time  
  * The zipline is in Vatnahalsen, penultimate stop before Myrdal when we can get off or go up to Myrdal and walk \~15 mins down the the zip line station  
* Expect to spend \~2.5 hrs on the entire round trip and this includes any stops to absorb scenery  
* Return back and have lunch in Flam. Lunch time will depend on when return (2PM/3PM)  
* Spend more time around beach and railway museum in Flam before starting for Gjendesheim  
  * The museum can also be done before boarding the train depending on time  
* Start for Gjendesheim between 4:30 & 5 PM. It’s a [3 hr drive to DNT Gjendesheim](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HEaP2GTDcY2GwCN79) in the summer with the scenic route (last leg) open to travel

* Total hike is expected to take between 7-9 hrs, including time to stop, enjoy sights and lunch  
* Option 1 for hike:  
  * Take the 7:45 AM ferry to Memurubru and start hike from there at 8:10 AM. This should get us back to the cabin at \~5:00 PM  
* Option 2 for hike:  
  * Start hiking from the Gjendesheim cabin at 7:30 AM and plan to be there for the 4:55 PM return ferry from Memurubu. Considering the hike, it may be a little tight and there is no backup ferry  
    * Could also try to start earlier to give us more time  
* Reach the cabin back at \~5:30 PM using either option. Decompress with dinner and shore up some energy  
* Try to start by 6:30 PM (checkout should have already happened in the morning) to Trondheim. [Drive is expected to be about \~4.5 hrs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qNeMdNt3oNRYefvg8); maybe pretty tiring but helps out with the train to catch next day  
  * If we get out early and want to eat solidly, can cook at hostel after reaching

### Things to see:

* **Anything along the Besseggen Ridge Hike**  
  * Most people take the ferry first and start the hike from Memurubru. First section from there is supposed to be steep and that would be last descent from the other side (along with timing the hike to the ferry timings)  
  * But starting from Gjendesheim is supposed to provide the best view all-around

### Stay for the night:

~~[Trondheim Vandrerhjem](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gpT76KhqN7jmEk2E7): Hostel in Trondheim. Standard hostel with cost $103 for bunk bed dormitory and $114 for single room (2 single beds)~~

## Day 5 (2023/07/03)

### Plan for the day:

* Start @ 7 AM from the hostel. Breakfast is not available at hostel, though meals are provided on train  
* Train is scheduled for 7:49 AM departure; [10 min drive to station from hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6uw1rBdhoZWXsCs2A). One of us drops off with luggage and finds train to load stuff  
* Other one goes to drop off the car at [Avis location after hours](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wJLR7ebDr9YYzEvV9) ([3 min drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2ZLtXuy9XTu4cLKRA)). [10 min walk back to station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/47GMauvECBgpwjYL6) projected to reach at 7:30 AM. Should have enough buffer time to make the train  
* Spend the day on the train until disembarking at Bodo at  5:44 PM. Bodo hostel is right across (2 min walk) from the station. Can get settled there and drop luggage; ready to start walking again between 6 \- 6:30 PM  
  * The evening ferry is at 6:45 PM, which might be difficult to make due to car pickup. Next one is at 10 PM and might be too late (reaches at 1:00 AM)  
* Spend the rest of the night walking around town and pick up a rental car from [Avis Bodo Airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3B5HvsRvAjfA51V5A) before closing for the night

## Day 6 (2023/07/04)

### Plan for the day:

* Take the early morning ferry to Moskenes.(3:15 AM/6 AM; 6 seems more reasonable). Ferry building is also close by (2 mins/1 km).  
  * Decided to take the **6AM** ferry.  
* Arrive in Moskenes at 9:15 AM and drive to A ([10 min drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oTqJoNbndGBCRWks5)) and have breakfast. Prepare to start at 10:00 for the road trip across Lofoten  
  * Checkout Ryten/Klavika beach hike(s) since we’re not doing Reinebringen  
* Try to cover as many points below as possible via road trip format. Total [drive time (only) is \~4.5 hr](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3L5s3LvgMfVP71TWA); budgeting 7.5 \- 8 hrs for it seems reasonable.  
* Last stop is Svolvaer. Stay can be here (so, check-in on arriving) or check-in to Stamsund if selecting that one  
* Do some water-based activity. There are a few options:  
  * Day Kayaking (last one is at 2 PM for 2 hrs; so probably difficult to get there in time)  
  * Trollfjord Cruise (again 2 PM for 3 hrs, so again difficult to get there in time)  
  * Evening Kayaking trip (at 7 PM for 2 hrs, might be our best option)  
  * Sea Eagle Safari (latest at 5 PM for 2 hrs, tight but possible)

### Things to see:

* **A (pronounced *aw*)**  
* **Reine & Reinesbringen**   
* **Ryten/Kvalvika Beach**

* **Vikten**  
* **Nusfjord**  
* **Unstad**  
* **Eggum**  
* **Lofoten Viking Museum**  
* **Henningsvaer**  
* **Svolvaer**

### Stay for the night:

[Stamsund Vandrerhjem](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KrRtYJL7ZtkxyCKaA): Maybe an option. No frills hostel with not a lot going on beds are at $51 for 2, but the added charges and how to book might be a pain  
Or stay in Svolvaer [Fast Hotel Lofoten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uT4qySsWPXM3gqFDA): simple hotel; cost $123 for a simple double room. Could be a more convenient place to stay

### Meals for the day:

* Breakfast in A, southern most point of Lofoten  
* Lunch in Reine (or further along the way)  
* Dinner in Svolvaer

### Bookings to make:

* Morning Ferry to Moskenes (6 AM)

* And then onto a 10 min [drive to Andenes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RGuo8HprgwpUSUnJ6); hope to reach at either 1 PM/2 PM for a safari. Options include  
  * Whale Watching; lasts 3 hrs  
  * Sea Eagle/ Puffin; lasts 1.5 hrs  
* Start from Andenes at 5 PM and have 2 options based on car rental requirements  
  * Option 1: Drive to Harstad/Narvik/Evenes airport hotel [for \~3.5 hrs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5XKMAGvAy2XjgdZ78). Reach \~8:30 and settle for the night  
  * Option 2: Drive to the [Bodo Hostel for \~7 hrs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d5X9WNSwCP2mXx4WA). This uses a ferry route from Lodingen to Bognes; smaller route with hourly frequency, so shouldn’t be a big problem
