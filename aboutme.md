_I'm Siddharth Divi , a Computer Science graduate student at Purdue University, West Lafayette. I'm also a Graduate Teaching Assistant for a graduate level course, CS529 : Security Analytics.
I'm interested in pursuing my Master's abroad in the fall of 2019 in Computer Science with
Data Science or Machine Learning, as my major (specialization)._

_I used to work as a part-time undergraduate research assistant and teaching assistant at
Solarillion Foundation for close to 2.5 years._

_My principal areas of research include Machine Learning , Deep Learning and Data Science._

_Apart from this, I also used to be a part of Make a Difference (MAD), which is an Indian
non-profit organisation, working to ensure better outcomes for children in orphanages
and shelters across India. It is also one of India's top 10 greatest places to work for.
This is my second year at MAD, and so far it has been a great learning experience
for me._

_Apart from all this, I actively play sports, with Tennis being my favourite, and I've also
competed at the regional and the national level. I also love long distance cycling._

_I am an avid reader of books, with my favourite authors being Carl Sagan, John Grisham,
Jeffrey Archer, David Baldacci and Dan Brown._

_What else do you need? Well, it's an open world and you know how to contact me._
