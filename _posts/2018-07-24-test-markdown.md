**Research Experience**
<br/>

:   **_1. Forecasting Complex Time-Sequenced Sales using Artificial Neural Networks_**  
This work comprises of online learning and feature engineering by data correlative analysis in conjecture with densely connected Neural Network to address the concept drifts and latent time correlations present in the data respectively, to make day-ahead prediction of food sales for one of the top multiplexes in India.
<br/>

:  **_2. Location Based Species Recommender System._**  
Prediction of top k species in a location based on the environmental features given in the form of tiff images. Done as part of GeoCLEF part of CLEF 2018 at Avignon, France. The work has been selected as working notes to be published in LNCS part of Springer Journal.
<br/>

:  **_3. Microsoft Summer Research Workshop 2018_**  
As part of the MSR Summer Workshop 2018 on 'Machine Learning on Constrained Devices', worked on extending two algorithms Bonsai and ProtoNN for regression. Part of the team that jointly won the MSR research grant. [Link][ref4]
