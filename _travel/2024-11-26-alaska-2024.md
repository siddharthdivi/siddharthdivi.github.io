## Day 7 (12/2/2024)


### Plan for the Day:

Plan for Anchorage (based on below list of attractions)


### Activities:



* Eat breakfast at the hotel (first thing in the morning, whenever it begins), and then head out to[ Byron Glacier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPOz2vF4Cs).
* Park at the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, the road beyond this is closed. It is an extra 0.6 miles to the start of the trailhead from the parking lot. And from there it is ~0.6 miles to the glacier (an ice cave marks the beginning of the glacier).
    * Pretty much snow/ice all through the hike, making it slower than usual. We can go as far as we can and check it out.
* After Byron, we’ll go to the nearby Portage glacier, the lake freezes over in the winter. But people bike/hike/ski on the frozen lake towards the glacier (important not to get too close to the glacier itself). 
    * This will be risky, but again, we’ll do it as far as possible and just take in the winter wonderland.
* After these outdoorsy activities, checkout the nearby [Alaska Wildlife Conservation](https://www.alaska.org/detail/alaska-wildlife-conservation-center) Center
* Head back to city to checkout the following museums (if time permits; they close ~5-6 PM)
    * Anchorage Museum
    * Alaska Native Heritage Museum
* Attractions in the city
    * Alaska Native Heritage Museum
    * Anchorage Museum
    * Tony Knowles Coastal Trail
    * Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum
    * Alaska Zoo
    * Flattop Blueberry Loop trail (1-2 hr hike)
    * Eagle River Nature Center
