## **Research Experience**
<br/>

:   **_1. Forecasting Food Sales in a Multiplex using Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks_**  
This work comprises of online learning and feature engineering by data correlative analysis in conjecture with densely connected Neural Network to address the concept drifts and latent time correlations present in the data respectively, to make day-ahead prediction of food sales for one of the top multiplexes in India. It has been accepted to be presented at Future of Information and Communication Conference (FICC), to be held at San-Fransisco 2019.
<br/>

:  **_2. Location Based Species Recommender System._**  
Prediction of top k species in a location based on the environmental features given in the form of tiff images. Devised a whole new architecture to factor in the concept of hierarchy, using embeddings. Done as part of GeoCLEF part of CLEF 2018 at Avignon, France. The work has been selected as working notes to be published in LNCS part of Springer Journal.
<br/>

:  **_3. Microsoft Summer Research Workshop 2018_**  
As part of the MSR Summer Workshop 2018 on 'Machine Learning on Constrained Devices', worked on extending two algorithms Bonsai and ProtoNN for regression. Worked on the Tensorflow version of the edgeML library of MSR, for extending these algorithms. I was also a part of the team that jointly won the MSR research grant. All the code and documentation can be found here. [Link][ref4]
